    - 🎱 [Install node dependencies](#install-node-dependencies)
- 🌩️ [Compile assets](#compile-assets)
- ⚛️ [Run the App](#run-the-app)

### Set up the Database
Since the application uses a PostgreSQL database, you will need to have **PostgreSQL** >= v9.3 installed (`sudo apt install postgresql libpq-dev`) and running (`sudo service postgresql start`). If you prefer to spin up a docker container for PostgreSQL, skip ahead to [Clone a fork of the project repository](#clone-a-fork-of-the-project-repository), then make sure to include the steps from [PostgreSQL in a docker container](#postgresql-in-a-docker-container).

> _If you are installing **PostgreSQL** for the first time, a default user `postgres` will be created, and will be locked._
> _You will need to set a password for this user: first run `sudo -u postgres psql template1`, then at the Postgres CLI type `\password`._
> _You will be prompted for the new password twice, after which you can exit with `CTRL-D`._
> _Edit the `pg_hba.conf` file (path `/etc/postgresql/15/main/pg_hba.conf`, according to your Postgres version) and change "peer" to "md5" for both the `postgres` user and `all` users:_
> ```diff
> # Database administrative login by Unix domain socket
> -local      all     postgres     peer
> +local      all     postgres     md5
> 
> # TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
> 
> # "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
> -local   all             all                                     peer
> +local   all             all                                     md5
> ```
> 
> _Restart the **PostgreSQL** service `sudo service postgresql restart` and test that the password is working: `psql -U postgres`._
> _You should be prompted for the password, and it should be accepted as you set it in the previous steps._

Let's create a database user `marriage_booklet` for our application: 
```bash
sudo createuser -U postgres -d -e -E -l -P -r -s marriage_booklet
```

You'll be prompted twice for a password for the new user, then you will be prompted for the `postgres` user password.
You should then see something like this:
```sql
SELECT pg_catalog.set_config('search_path', '', false);
CREATE ROLE marriage_booklet PASSWORD '[password-hash-here]' SUPERUSER CREATEDB CREATEROLE INHERIT LOGIN;
```

Test that you can log into the **PostgreSQL CLI** as the new user: `psql -U marriage_booklet template1`.

Let's create an environment variable with the database password: edit your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc` and add these lines at the end:
```bash
export MARRIAGE_BOOKLET_DATABASE_USER="marriage_booklet"
export MARRIAGE_BOOKLET_DATABASE_PASSWORD="[password-here]"
```

Close your terminal and open a new terminal for the environment variable to be picked up.
Double check that the environment variables are available: 

```bash
echo $MARRIAGE_BOOKLET_DATABASE_USER
echo $MARRIAGE_BOOKLET_DATABASE_PASSWORD
```

### Clone a fork of the project repository

As an example, we will clone the **marriage-booklet** project to our **home** directory under a **development** subdirectory.
Please adjust any of the following instructions based on the folder you choose to develop under.
We will actually clone a fork of the project, seeing that any patches we would like to contribute
will be developed as branches on a fork and then submitted as PR's against the main repo.

So as a first step, from the Github repo https://github.com/opensourcecatholic/marriage-booklet,
click on "fork" at the top right hand side of the screen. Then clone the fork:

```bash
cd ~
mkdir development
cd development
git clone git@github.com:YourGithubUsername/marriage-booklet.git
cd marriage-booklet
```

(Substitute _YourGithubUsername_ with your Github username or with whatever url your fork refers to, such as an organization perhaps).
The project will now be cloned in a **marriage-booklet** subfolder of the **development** folder.

##### PostgreSQL in a docker container
A `docker-compose.yml` file has been included in the repo, if you prefer to use a docker container as your **PostgreSQL** instance. First, create (in the project's main directory, alongside docker-compose.yml) an `.env` file with the following environment variables:
```diff
MARRIAGE_BOOKLET_DATABASE_USER="marriage_booklet"
MARRIAGE_BOOKLET_DATABASE_PASSWORD="[password-here]"
ADMINER_PORT=8080
```

An instance of [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) has been included in the **docker compose** file, so as to offer a tool that can help inspect the database and the tables.
You may change the port in the `.env` file to your liking. If you do not supply the `ADMINER_PORT` environment variable,
the adminer instance will default to port **8080**.

Now running `docker-compose up` should spin up the **PostgreSQL** instance, which will become available on the unix socket.

And you should get the **Adminer** interface at `http://localhost:[ADMINER_PORT]` (for example, `http://localhost:8080`).
You can log into the adminer interface with:

|          |          |
|:---------|:---------|
|System    |PostgreSQL|
|Server    |db        |
|Username  |[MARRIAGE_BOOKLET_DATABASE_USER]    |
|Password  |[MARRIAGE_BOOKLET_DATABASE_PASSWORD]|
|Database  |marriage_booklet_development        |

(Switch out Username and Password with whatever you put in the `.env` file.)

### Install Ruby

The first thing you'll need is the correct version of Ruby. We track this in the
`.ruby-version` file, and tools like [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) can
use that file to switch to the correct version.

We recommend installing [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and using it to
install the correct version. Installation instructions can be found in the rbenv
README. An example is included here also. If you already have `rbenv` installed
you can skip ahead to [Test for the correct version of ruby](#Test-for-the-correct-version-of-ruby)

***

_An example installation for Ubuntu 20.04 in a WSL2 instance on Windows, using **rbenv-installer**:_
```bash
~$ curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/HEAD/bin/rbenv-installer | bash
~$ nano ~/.profile
```
_Paste this at the end of the .profile or .bash_profile file:_
```bash
# set PATH so it includes ~/.rbenv/shims if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/.rbenv/shims" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/shims:$PATH"
fi

# set PATH so it includes ~/.rbenv/bin if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/.rbenv/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"
fi
```
_(`CTRL-O` to save and `CTRL-X` to exit, if using **nano**.)_

_Close the terminal window and open a new instance, so that the **PATH** variable is reinstantiated._
_Verify the state of the installation:_
```bash
~$ curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/HEAD/bin/rbenv-doctor | bash
```

_You should see a message along the lines of:_
```bash
Checking for `rbenv' in PATH: ~/.rbenv/bin/rbenv
Checking for rbenv shims in PATH: not found
  The directory `~/.rbenv/shims' must be present in PATH for rbenv to work.
  Please run `rbenv init' and follow the instructions.

Checking `rbenv install` support: ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin/rbenv-install (ruby-build 20210611-1-g1b477ae)
Counting installed Ruby versions: none
  There aren't any Ruby versions installed under `~/.rbenv/versions'.
  You can install Ruby versions like so: rbenv install 3.0.1
Checking RubyGems settings: OK
Auditing installed plugins: OK
```

_If you run `rbenv init` you may see a message like this:_
```bash
# Load rbenv automatically by appending
# the following to ~/.bashrc:

eval "$(rbenv init - bash)"
```

_It seems that ~/.bashrc can be read before ~/.profile, because when adding the above to .bashrc I was still getting an error "command rbenv not found"._
_So I had to give the path to **rbenv** in my .bashrc:_
```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

_Paste this at the bottom:_
```bash
eval "$(~/.rbenv/bin/rbenv init - bash)"
```

_(`CTRL-O` to save and `CTRL-X` to exit, if using **nano**.)_

_You should now be able to install a ruby version._
```bash
~$ rbenv install 3.2.0
```
_(If this results in an error "No acceptable C compiler found in PATH", you must install **build-essential**, make sure you have all necessary dependencies installed:_
```bash
~$ sudo apt update
~$ sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libsqlite3-dev
```
_Then try `rbenv install 3.2.0` again.)_

_You should see output along these lines:_
```bash
Installing ruby-3.2.0...
Installed ruby-3.2.0 to ~/.rbenv/versions/3.2.0
```
***

##### Test for the correct version of ruby

Now, running `ruby --version` from within the application directory should give you something like `ruby 3.2.0 (2022-12-25 revision a528908271) [x86_64-linux]`.
You probably won't be able to run the `rails` command yet, until you have installed the rails gem. However we use **bundler** to manage our ruby gems, so you will have to continue through the next two steps before being able to check your `rails --version`.

### Install Bundler

We use [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) to manage our ruby gems. You'll probably
need to install this gem. If you used rbenv to install Ruby, you should be able
to run `gem install bundler` without sudo and bundler should be installed to the
correct location.

### Install ruby gem dependencies

After Bundler is installed, you can use it to install our dependencies with
`bundle install`. Our dependencies are tracked in `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock`.

(Make sure you are in the project directory, wherever you cloned your fork to,
for example `~/development/marriage-booklet/`.)

Note that any time the `Gemfile` is updated with new dependencies,
`bundle install` will need to be run again to install the new dependencies.
If you haven't run `bundle install` after new dependencies are defined,
you will probably get an error message when trying to run `bundle exec rails server` (see below),
similar to:

```ruby
Could not find rack-proxy-0.7.0 in any of the sources
Run `bundle install` to install missing gems.
```

### Check your environment

You should now be able to see the version of rails when running `bundle exec rails --version`, with an output of `Rails 7.0.4`.

Since the **rails** gem is made available through **bundler**, it needs to be invoked with `bundle exec`. However you should also be able to invoke `rails --version` directly, seeing that a rails binstub has been included in the `bin` folder (it shouldn't be necessary to run `bundle binstubs rails` which will install an executable to the `bin` folder which is simply a wrapper for the `bundle exec rails` commands).

You can check your rails environment with `bundle exec rails about`. You should get an output something like:

```bash
About your application's environment
About your application's environment
Rails version             7.0.4
Ruby version              ruby 3.2.0 (2022-12-25 revision a528908271) [x86_64-linux]
RubyGems version          3.4.2
Rack version              2.2.5
Middleware                ActionDispatch::HostAuthorization, Rack::Sendfile, ActionDispatch::Static, ActionDispatch::Executor, ActionDispatch::ServerTiming, ActiveSupport::Cache::Strategy::LocalCache::Middleware, Rack::Runtime, Rack::MethodOverride, ActionDispatch::RequestId, ActionDispatch::RemoteIp, Sprockets::Rails::QuietAssets, Rails::Rack::Logger, ActionDispatch::ShowExceptions, WebConsole::Middleware, ActionDispatch::DebugExceptions, ActionDispatch::ActionableExceptions, ActionDispatch::Reloader, ActionDispatch::Callbacks, ActiveRecord::Migration::CheckPending, ActionDispatch::Cookies, ActionDispatch::Session::CookieStore, ActionDispatch::Flash, ActionDispatch::ContentSecurityPolicy::Middleware, ActionDispatch::PermissionsPolicy::Middleware, Rack::Head, Rack::ConditionalGet, Rack::ETag, Rack::TempfileReaper
Application root          /home/johnrdorazio/development/marriage-booklet
Environment               development
Database adapter          postgresql
Database schema version   20230104190635
```

### Load the database schema
Run `bundle exec rails db:setup`. This will create the `development` and `test` databases and load the current `schema`.

### Check NodeJS environment

With Rails 7, node isn't strictly required. It may be needed to issue commands for the `i18n-js` CLI
such as `i18n export`, or `i18n lint:scripts` or `i18n lint:translations`. For this reason we have kept
the `.nvmrc` and `.node-version` files in the repository, so that if you need to use these commands
you can install and automatically use a recent version of node (we suggest to use `nvm` and `avm` to install
and automatically switch to the version of node indicated in these files).

### Compile assets
Assets for the application (`JS`, `CSS`, and images) may need to be precompiled in order for the test environment to work correctly:
```bash
bundle exec rails assets:precompile
```

### Run the App

After all dependencies are installed with Bundler, 
you can run the app in development mode with `bundle exec rails server`.
In order for live reloading to work, you will need to have `redis-server` installed and running.

Using `bin/dev` (new in Rails 7 when CSS frameworks are associated with the rails applications)
rather than `bundle exec rails server` will ensure that CSS assets are re-compiled after any changes are made.

The `bundle exec` part of `bundle exec rails server` isn't always required, 
but will ensure you use the correct version of dependencies 
in case there are multiple versions installed.

Once the server is running, you can open it in a browser at <http://127.0.0.1:3000> (or <http://localhost:3000>).
